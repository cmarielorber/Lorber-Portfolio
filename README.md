# My React Portfolio

This portfolio was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is a space to not only display my projects while applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to share my work with other developers and collaborate on projects. The portfolio was deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages).

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer   
WHEN I load the portfolio   
THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
WHEN I view the header  
THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio   
WHEN I view the navigation titles   
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted 
WHEN I click on a navigation title  
THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted    
WHEN I load the portfolio the first time    
THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default 
WHEN I am presented with the About Me section   
THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them 
WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section  
THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories  
WHEN I am presented with the Contact section    
THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message   
WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text   
THEN I receive a notification that this field is required

WHEN I view the footer  
THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)

## Installation and Usage

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
